        "description": "The Bicycle, a mode of transport, form of exercise, and recreational hobby for many, is the vehicle that you don't need a liscense to ride.This description of a bicycle will purposefully uncover the major parts or features of a bicycle for those who want a basic or general understanding of the subject. If you ride a bike, want to ride a bike, or hope to buy and then ride a bike, a general understanding of how your bike works will really help you become a better cyclist. Bicycles are a safe and healthy choice for our communities and societies. Especially for city dwellers, bicycles are the prefered method of transit. For every bicycle there is one less car roving the streets polluting our air and creating wreckage in our homes. The bicycle is a two wheeled, pedal driven machine, held together by a framework of metal tubes, with a seat and handlebars for the rider. Bicycles have five main features: the motor, the frame, the wheels, the saddle, and the handlebars."
